# Contributing to ACP

Thank you for your interest in the ACP standard. This is a community-driven open specification — contributions of all kinds are welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

### Feedback on the Spec
The spec is in active draft (v0.1). If something is unclear, missing, or wrong — open an issue. Label it `spec-feedback`.

### Implementation Reports
Built an ACP implementation? Open a PR to add it to the implementations table in README.md.

Include:
- Package/repo name and link
- agID (if using agAuth)
- Transport(s) supported (MCP, HTTP, WebSocket)
- Capabilities declared
- Any deviations or extensions

### Transport Binding Proposals
Want to propose a new transport binding (gRPC, NATS, etc.)? Open an issue with `transport-binding` label to discuss before writing the spec extension.

### Spec Proposals
Open an issue with `spec-proposal` label first to discuss before opening a PR against `spec/SPEC.md`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b your-change-description`
3. Make your changes
4. Open a PR with a clear description
5. PRs to `spec/SPEC.md` require prior issue discussion

## Code of Conduct

Direct, constructive, respectful. Technical disagreements are expected and welcome. Personal attacks are not.
